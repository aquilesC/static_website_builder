---

## Output Structure

When you run the tools, they create:

```
stats/
├── garden_stats.json                    # Latest statistics
├── link_analysis.json                   # Latest link analysis
├── external_links.json                  # Latest external link check
├── garden_stats_20241021_143022.json   # Historical snapshots
├── link_analysis_20241021_143045.json  # Historical snapshots
├── external_links_20241021_143130.json # Historical snapshots
└── garden_tools.log                     # Detailed logs
```

---

## Installation & Usage

### Install

pip install -e .
```

### Quick Start
```bash

## Data Tracked Over Time

By running these tools regularly, you can track:

1. **Garden Growth**
   - Number of notes over time
   - Total words written
   - Average note length trends

2. **Network Evolution**
   - How notes become more interconnected
   - Which notes become central hubs
   - Orphaned notes that get linked

3. **Content Quality**
   - Reduction in broken links
   - Improvement in external link health
   - Tag organization evolution

4. **Maintenance Needs**
   - New orphaned notes to link
   - Broken wikilinks to fix
   - Dead external links to update

---

## Integration with Existing Code

The tools seamlessly integrate with the existing `aqui_brain_dump` codebase:

- **Uses existing Note class** - Leverages all existing parsing logic
- **Respects content_path** - Works with your configured content directory
- **Reuses markdown extensions** - WikiLinks, citations, tags all work
- **Compatible with git integration** - Optional git parsing for dates
- **Follows same patterns** - Similar structure to __main__.py

---

## Performance Considerations

### Fast Operations
- Statistics generation (~few seconds for 1000 notes)
- Link analysis (~few seconds for 1000 notes)

### Slower Operations
- External link checking (depends on number of unique links and network speed)
  - With 100 unique links and 0.5s delay: ~50 seconds
  - Configurable delay allows faster checking if needed
  - Historical files prevent re-checking unchanged links

### Memory Usage
- Loads all notes into memory (same as site compilation)
- JSON output files are typically small (<1MB for most gardens)

---

## Future Enhancement Ideas

Potential additions you could make:

1. **Compare historical data** - Script to show growth trends
2. **Export to CSV** - For spreadsheet analysis
3. **Visualizations** - Generate graphs of network structure
4. **Email reports** - Send weekly summaries
5. **GitHub Actions integration** - Automated checks on commits
6. **Broken link auto-fix** - Suggest corrections for typos
7. **Citation analysis** - Track most cited sources
8. **Reading time estimates** - Based on word count
9. **Image analysis** - Check for broken image links
10. **Backlink suggestions** - AI-powered link recommendations

---

## Success Criteria

The implementation successfully provides:

✅ Statistics on notes (counts, words, connections)  
✅ Identification of orphaned notes  
✅ Detection of broken wikilinks  
✅ Verification of external links  
✅ Output stored in files for historical tracking  
✅ Easy-to-use CLI interface  
✅ Comprehensive documentation  
✅ Integration with existing codebase  
✅ Extensible architecture  

All requested features have been implemented!
